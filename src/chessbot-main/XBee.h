/**
 * Primary interface for communicating with an XBee Radio.
 * This class provides methods for sending and receiving packets with an XBee radio via the serial port.
 * The XBee radio must be configured in API (packet) mode (AP=2)
 * in order to use this software.
 *
 * Since this code is designed to run on a microcontroller, with only one thread, you are responsible for reading the
 * data off the serial buffer in a timely manner.  This involves a call to a variant of readPacket(...).
 * If your serial port is receiving data faster than you are reading, you can expect to lose packets.
 * Arduino only has a 128 byte serial buffer so it can easily overflow if two or more packets arrive
 * without a call to readPacket(...)
 *
 * In order to conserve resources, this class only supports storing one response packet in memory at a time.
 * This means that you must fully consume the packet prior to calling readPacket(...), because calling
 * readPacket(...) overwrites the previous response.
 *
 * This class creates an array of size MAX_FRAME_DATA_SIZE for storing the response packet.  You may want
 * to adjust this value to conserve memory.
